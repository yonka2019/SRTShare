# SRTShare
Desktop application [client app & server console app] which is written on C#. A screenshare (video & audio transmission) application which works through self-made protocol which is based on SRT protocol.
Allows the server share his screen to multiple number of clients which connected to him through the network (LAN/WAN support).

The protocol includes 3 encryption types, such as: AES256, XOR, Substitution method. 
In addition, the application provides option for retransmission mechanism and much more preferences which each client can modify according to his personal desire.
